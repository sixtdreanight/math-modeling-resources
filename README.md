## Usage Guide

### Quick Start

1. **Determine the problem type** → Refer to the quick reference matrix above to locate the model directory
2. **Read the model documentation** → `models/<category>/<model-name>.md` to understand principles and applicable scenarios
3. **Run code examples** → `algorithms/{python,matlab}/` contains independently runnable implementations
4. **Apply thesis templates** → `templates/latex/` contains MCM/CUMCM thesis templates

### Model Document Structure

Each `.md` file contains:
1. Model principles (mathematical formulas + intuitive explanations)
2. Applicable scenarios (competition problem types + typical problem examples)
3. Modeling steps (step-by-step instructions)
4. Code implementation (Python + MATLAB key snippets)
5. Important notes (pros and cons, common pitfalls, parameter tuning suggestions)
6. Thesis presentation suggestions (equation numbering, chart types, conclusion writing)
7. References

### Code Usage

```bash
# Python example
python algorithms/python/grey_model.py

# MATLAB example (run in MATLAB)
run('algorithms/matlab/grey_model.m')
```

Each file includes `if __name__ == '__main__':` (Python) or built-in example data (MATLAB), and can be run directly for verification.
